## Product Vision Statement

Provide a fair scheduling system for the Hudson River Park tennis court and a platform for the players to connect with each other, making it easy for them to find players with similar skill levels. 

## User Requirements

* As a tennis player user, I want to log in so that I can track what time slots and games I’ve booked.
* As a tennis player user, I want to log out so that others can use the app on my device.
* As a tennis player user, I want to change my username and password so that I can keep my information private.
* As a beginner tennis player user, I want to be able to play even without a ranking so that I can play without setting up other accounts.
* As an experienced tennis player user, I want to be able to connect my UTR rating so that I can compare my level with potential playing partners.
* As a tennis player user, I want to message potential playing partners so that I can find them at the court.
* As a tennis player user, I want to report other users so that I can prevent bad actors from using the app.
* As a tennis player user, I want to book time slots so that I can reserve slots in advance without having to wait physically at the courts.
* As a tennis player user, I want to cancel time slots so that I can let other players book if I can’t make it.
* As a tennis player user, I want the app to limit other user’s playing time so that I can have equal playing time as other players.
